Atto multilanguage plugin
=========================

![Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-v1.3-brightgreen.svg) ![Supported](https://img.shields.io/badge/supported-Moodle%202.9,%20Moodle%203.0-green.svg)

This plugin will make the creation of multilingual contents on Moodle much more easier with Atto editor.

The plugin is developed to work with [IÃ±aki Arenaza's multilang2 filter](https://github.com/iarenaza/moodle-filter_multilang2), and the idea is based on [his plugin for TinyMCE editor](https://github.com/iarenaza/moodle-tinymce_moodlelang2).

## Current version
The latest release is the v1.3 (build 2016041400) for Moodle 2.9 and 3.0. Checkout [v2.9.1.3](https://github.com/julenpardo/moodle-atto_multilang2/releases/tag/v2.9.1.3) and [v3.0.1.3](https://github.com/julenpardo/moodle-atto_multilang2/releases/tag/v3.0.1.3) releases, respectively.

## Changes from v1.2
 - Fix bug that was making the non load of the plugin, and the breaking of the following JavaScript (see [issue 12](https://github.com/julenpardo/moodle-atto_multilang2/issues/12)).
 - Disable unnecesary operations when the highlight setting was not set (see [issue 13](https://github.com/julenpardo/moodle-atto_multilang2/issues/13)).

## Requirements
As mentioned before, [filter_multilang2](https://github.com/iarenaza/moodle-filter_multilang2) is required.
