Atto multilanguage plugin
=====================

This plugin, currently under development, will make the creation of multilingual contents on Moodle much more easier with Atto editor.

The plugin is developed to work with [IÃ±aki Arenaza's multilang2 filter](https://github.com/iarenaza/moodle-filter_multilang2), and the idea is based on [his plugin for TinyMCE editor](https://github.com/iarenaza/moodle-tinymce_moodlelang2).

Further information will be added along with the first stable release.
